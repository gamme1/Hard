# Upload Payment Proof Error - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
When users clicked the "üì§ Upload Payment Proof" button, they received an error message: **"‚ùå Unknown action. Please try again."**

## Root Cause
The issue was a **missing callback handler** in the code:

1. **Button generates callback**: Line 713 creates a button with `callback_data=f"upload_payment_{booking_id}"`
2. **No handler exists**: The `handle_callback_query` function (lines 1648-1764) had no handler for `upload_payment_` callbacks
3. **Falls to default**: Unknown callbacks trigger the "Unknown action" error message

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Callback Handler
Added a new handler in `handle_callback_query` function:
```python
elif data.startswith('upload_payment_'):
    booking_id = data.split('_')[2]
    # Set user state to expect payment proof photo for this booking
    teacher_edit_states[user.id] = {
        'state': TEACHER_EDIT_STATES['WAITING_FOR_PAYMENT_PROOF'],
        'booking_id': booking_id
    }
    # Send instruction message to user
```

### 2. Enhanced Photo Handler
Updated `handle_photo` function to process payment proof uploads:
```python
elif state['state'] == TEACHER_EDIT_STATES['WAITING_FOR_PAYMENT_PROOF']:
    # Handle payment proof upload
    booking_id = state['booking_id']
    photo = update.message.photo[-1]
    # Process and confirm receipt
```

### 3. Added State Constant
Added new state to `TEACHER_EDIT_STATES` for consistency:
```python
'WAITING_FOR_PAYMENT_PROOF': 'waiting_for_payment_proof'
```

### 4. Bonus: Added Cancel Booking Handler
Also implemented the missing `cancel_booking_` callback handler for completeness.

## User Flow Now Works Correctly

1. ‚úÖ User clicks "üì§ Upload Payment Proof"
2. ‚úÖ System prompts user to send photo with booking ID context
3. ‚úÖ User sends photo
4. ‚úÖ System confirms receipt and notifies about verification process
5. ‚úÖ State is properly cleared

## Files Modified
- `hard.py` - Added callback handlers and enhanced photo processing

The error is now resolved and the upload payment proof functionality works as intended.
